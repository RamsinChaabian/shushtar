	"monarehtitle": "Shushtar Grand Mosque",
	"monarehcaption": "The construction of Shushtar Grand Mosque dates back to the early Islamic period and the thirteenth Abbasid Caliphate, during the time of Imam Hasan Askari's caliphate. Located in the western side of Shushtar, historical texts suggest it was founded in 254 AH by Al-Mu'tazz Billah (Abbasid caliph) and later completed by Al-Mustarshid Billah (another Abbasid caliph). Initially built in an Arabesque style, it featured a prayer hall and possibly a courtyard with arcades. Over time, renovations in the Safavid era transformed it into its current form, characterized by brick vaults and stone foundations.The mosque's prayer hall boasts 48 stone columns supporting domed ceilings. It also houses a wooden pulpit and inscriptions in Thuluth, Kufic, and Naskh scripts. The exterior walls feature carved stone columns with tall Romanesque arches and intricate motifs. The eastern side hosts remnants of a magnificent minaret from the eighth century, though only 16 meters of its original 26 meters remain today, with a historical inscription atop it attributing its construction to Sultan Oweis bin Hasan Ilkhan.Each Abbasid caliph involved in the mosque's affairs commissioned inscriptions, and numerous governmental decrees and hadiths were inscribed on the walls, of which only 19 remain. These inscriptions, some of which date back to the 20th century, reflect various governmental orders, including prohibitions on wine drinking and pigeon-fighting, as well as instructions regarding the castle's chains. The mosque, after Kufa Mosque, is described in Dehkhoda's dictionary as having the most moderate qibla direction among all mosques.",
	"abshara2title": "Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System: A Masterpiece of Ancient Engineering",
	"abshara2caption": "Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System was inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 2009, marking Iran's 10th cultural heritage site to be recognized by the United Nations.This engineering marvel is unparalleled both in Iran and globally. Developed by the Sassanids, whose economy relied heavily on agriculture, the system boasts extensive irrigation infrastructure including water mills, dams, tunnels, and canals. The Gargar Bridge-Dam, built atop water mills and waterfalls, and the Bolayti canal, which supplies water to the eastern side of the water mills, are notable features. The Dahaneye shahr tunnel and Seh kooreh canal further demonstrate the sophisticated water management techniques employed.At the heart of the system lies the Band-e Kaisar ('Caesar's dam'), a 500-meter long Roman weir constructed across the Karun River by Roman engineers in the 3rd century AD under Sassanid rule. This innovative structure, along with the Mizan Dam, facilitated the diversion of river water into the surrounding irrigation canals.Parts of the irrigation system are believed to date back to the reign of Darius the Great, featuring primary diversion canals still in use today. These canals deliver water to Shushtar city through a network of tunnels. The Salasel Castle serves as the central point of the hydraulic system, complemented by a tower for water level measurement, bridges, dams, mills, and basins.The impact of the system extends to the plain south of the city, where it enables farming in the area known as Mianâb and the cultivation of orchards. Mianâb, situated between the Shutayt and Gargar diversion canals on the Karun River, encompasses Shushtar city at its northern end.UNESCO has hailed the site as 'a masterpiece of creative genius,' recognizing its significance in human history and technological innovation."
