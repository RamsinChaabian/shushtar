	"monarehcaption": "The construction of Shushtar Grand Mosque dates back to the early Islamic period and the thirteenth Abbasid Caliphate, during the time of Imam Hasan Askari's caliphate. Located in the western side of Shushtar, historical texts suggest it was founded in 254 AH by Al-Mu'tazz Billah (Abbasid caliph) and later completed by Al-Mustarshid Billah (another Abbasid caliph). Initially built in an Arabesque style, it featured a prayer hall and possibly a courtyard with arcades. Over time, renovations in the Safavid era transformed it into its current form, characterized by brick vaults and stone foundations.The mosque's prayer hall boasts 48 stone columns supporting domed ceilings. It also houses a wooden pulpit and inscriptions in Thuluth, Kufic, and Naskh scripts. The exterior walls feature carved stone columns with tall Romanesque arches and intricate motifs. The eastern side hosts remnants of a magnificent minaret from the eighth century, though only 16 meters of its original 26 meters remain today, with a historical inscription atop it attributing its construction to Sultan Oweis bin Hasan Ilkhan.Each Abbasid caliph involved in the mosque's affairs commissioned inscriptions, and numerous governmental decrees and hadiths were inscribed on the walls, of which only 19 remain. These inscriptions, some of which date back to the 20th century, reflect various governmental orders, including prohibitions on wine drinking and pigeon-fighting, as well as instructions regarding the castle's chains. The mosque, after Kufa Mosque, is described in Dehkhoda's dictionary as having the most moderate qibla direction among all mosques.",

	"abshara2caption": "Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System was inscribed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 2009, marking Iran's 10th cultural heritage site to be recognized by the United Nations.This engineering marvel is unparalleled both in Iran and globally. Developed by the Sassanids, whose economy relied heavily on agriculture, the system boasts extensive irrigation infrastructure including water mills, dams, tunnels, and canals. The Gargar Bridge-Dam, built atop water mills and waterfalls, and the Bolayti canal, which supplies water to the eastern side of the water mills, are notable features. The Dahaneye shahr tunnel and Seh kooreh canal further demonstrate the sophisticated water management techniques employed.At the heart of the system lies the Band-e Kaisar ('Caesar's dam'), a 500-meter long Roman weir constructed across the Karun River by Roman engineers in the 3rd century AD under Sassanid rule. This innovative structure, along with the Mizan Dam, facilitated the diversion of river water into the surrounding irrigation canals.Parts of the irrigation system are believed to date back to the reign of Darius the Great, featuring primary diversion canals still in use today. These canals deliver water to Shushtar city through a network of tunnels. The Salasel Castle serves as the central point of the hydraulic system, complemented by a tower for water level measurement, bridges, dams, mills, and basins.The impact of the system extends to the plain south of the city, where it enables farming in the area known as Mianâb and the cultivation of orchards. Mianâb, situated between the Shutayt and Gargar diversion canals on the Karun River, encompasses Shushtar city at its northern end.UNESCO has hailed the site as 'a masterpiece of creative genius,' recognizing its significance in human history and technological innovation.",

	"selasal2caption": "The Salasel Castle is one of the most famous attractions in Shushtar, whose history dates back to the Achaemenid period, according to historical writings. This castle, which was very vast in the past, had several courtyards and different sections. Additionally, its excellent fortifications, magnificent pavilions, and decorations adorned with gold, enamel, and turquoise are among the valuable features of Salasel. The renowned French archaeologist Dieulafoy, dispatched by the French government, said about the castle in 1881: ‘Salasel Castle is the official residence of the governor of Khuzestan and is located on a mountain that resembles a small plateau. One of the branches of the Karun River, called Shatit, passes from the foot of this mountain, and the buildings and fortifications remaining from the Sassanian era defend it from the side of the city.’In addition to its strategic, military, and governmental importance, Salasel Castle was likely a place for supervising water distribution and the region's water management center. Although the grandeur of Salasel's citadel has been lost over time due to erosion, its remnants still testify to the magnificence of this beautiful citadel. Due to its historical significance and value, Salasel Castle was listed as a national heritage site of Iran on July 5, 2009 (Tir 5, 1388), and today it hosts tourists as one of the attractions of Khuzestan province. Furthermore, in the annual session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee on June 26, 2009 (Tir 5, 1388), this castle was registered as the historical water management system of Shushtar in the UNESCO World Heritage List with number 1315.Historical sources indicate that Salasel Castle has existed in this region since the Achaemenid period and has been inhabited until about 50 years ago. Apart from its defensive role, this castle was the control center of the Dariun River and was considered the residence of the governor of Khuzestan.Until the reign of Nader Shah, Salasel Castle was the residence of local rulers. Each ruler had their own mansion within the castle until, after Nader Shah, the castle was abandoned, and the provincial governor no longer resided there. During the reign of Naser al-Din Shah, the castle was renovated and inhabited again until, in 1341 AH (Islamic calendar), the head of the Assets Department at the time demolished all its buildings to construct the Assets Department building, using the materials of the castle.According to the historian Sultan Zain al-Din, the castle was a prison during the reign of Mansur Al-Muzaffar. Amir Timur Gurkani conquered this castle during his invasion of Khuzestan, and the Lur and Masha'ashiyan tribes of Khuzestan, relying on this castle, rebelled against the Safavid government several times.Salasel Castle has been reconstructed several times. Currently, the ruins visible in the castle belong to the Qajar period. Some attribute the name Salasel to a person named Abi Salasel who lived in the fourth century and was responsible for repairing the castle. Salasel Castle was also repaired once by Fath Ali Khan, the son of Vakhtu Khan, in the 11th century and again in 1237 by Mohammad Ali Mirza Doulatchahi.Salasel Castle can be considered one of the multi-purpose fortresses. The castle has two large gates. The southeast gate of the castle (Gas Station Alley) was a private gate, and military leaders used it for passage. According to Qajar period tourists, there was a wooden door at this location. The southern gate was next to Shah Safi Mosque, apparently used by ordinary people for passage. There was a trench on the north and northeast sides of the castle, and the Dariun River was located on its south side. The castle towers were circular, and in recent periods, facilities such as a bakery, stable, bathhouse, barracks, arsenal, kitchen, and various courtyards existed within it.Additionally, Salasel Castle had five large underground channels, each connected to the city's internal channels. These channels provided a cool environment, around 15 degrees cooler than the 50-degree heat of Khuzestan, for the people.These bridges were located over the moat surrounding the castle. According to studies, materials used in these bridges included stone, brick, Sarouj mortar, and plaster. Currently, no traces of these bridges remain.In the past, there was a moat around the castle, which likely completely surrounded the southern sides of the castle and was connected on one side to the Karun River (Shatit branch) and on the other side to the Dariun River. A survey conducted in 2005 near the castle's south, close to Baru, revealed evidence of the existence of a moat. The moat functioned by filling it with water from the river during wartime to act as a barrier against enemy attacks.The castle's baru, which was very sturdy and rough, did not follow any specific shape or order. The materials used in it were of two types; initially, its foundation was raised with sandstone and Sarouj mortar, and then it was plastered. Remnants of the castle's baru and fence can be seen on the southern side of the castle. Remnants of a circular tower of the castle, with a diameter of 30.5 meters, remain at its northwest end, which has been leveled with the late period's bedding.The castle's mansion, some attributing its construction to Ahmad Shah Qajar, was used as the governor's residence in the highest part of the castle. The castle was built on a terrace that was several steps higher than the castle's courtyard. Currently, only one floor of this mansion remains.Although the architectural remains of the castle and especially its mansion were rebuilt during the Fath Ali Shah Qajar period by Mohammad Ali Mirza Doulatchahi, it has not yet been confirmed through archaeological excavations, and there is a possibility that its remains will be found in the lower layers of the castle, including under the mansion's foundation. Construction or repairs carried out by Ehtesham al-Sultanah and Hossein Qoli Khan Nizam, the rulers of Khuzestan during Naser al-Din Shah's reign, in Salasel Castle provide historical documents and archaeological evidence that provide more details.Under Salasel Castle, an ancient tunnel, 200 meters long, has been dug, which is known as the Dariun River. They estimate the age of this tunnel to be 2500 years old, and its purpose was to divert the Karun River under the city of Shushtar. This tunnel still exists, and it has been illuminated for tourists' visits."
