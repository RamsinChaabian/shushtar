	"monarehtitle": "Shushtar Grand Mosque",
	"monarehcaption": "The construction of Shushtar Grand Mosque dates back to the early Islamic period and the thirteenth Abbasid Caliphate, during the time of Imam Hasan Askari's caliphate. Located in the western side of Shushtar, historical texts suggest it was founded in 254 AH by Al-Mu'tazz Billah (Abbasid caliph) and later completed by Al-Mustarshid Billah (another Abbasid caliph). Initially built in an Arabesque style, it featured a prayer hall and possibly a courtyard with arcades. Over time, renovations in the Safavid era transformed it into its current form, characterized by brick vaults and stone foundations.The mosque's prayer hall boasts 48 stone columns supporting domed ceilings. It also houses a wooden pulpit and inscriptions in Thuluth, Kufic, and Naskh scripts. The exterior walls feature carved stone columns with tall Romanesque arches and intricate motifs. The eastern side hosts remnants of a magnificent minaret from the eighth century, though only 16 meters of its original 26 meters remain today, with a historical inscription atop it attributing its construction to Sultan Oweis bin Hasan Ilkhan.Each Abbasid caliph involved in the mosque's affairs commissioned inscriptions, and numerous governmental decrees and hadiths were inscribed on the walls, of which only 19 remain. These inscriptions, some of which date back to the 20th century, reflect various governmental orders, including prohibitions on wine drinking and pigeon-fighting, as well as instructions regarding the castle's chains. The mosque, after Kufa Mosque, is described in Dehkhoda's dictionary as having the most moderate qibla direction among all mosques."
